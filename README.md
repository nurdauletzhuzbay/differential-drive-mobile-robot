#Differential Drive Mobile Robot with ANN
This project implements differential drive forward kinematics of a mobile robot along with very simple ANN to avoid obstacles. It has touch sensors that detect the obstacles and light sensor that moves the robot towards the light source. The structure of ANN is shown in the figure.
